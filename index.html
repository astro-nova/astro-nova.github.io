							My name is <strong>Liza Sazonova</strong>. I am a Canadian Rubin Postdoctoral Fellow at the Univesity of Waterloo in Canada.
							I work with people across the world to study
							how do galaxies like our own Milky Way die.
						</p>
						<p class="major">
							In particular, I study how the <strong>structure of galaxies changes</strong> as they evolve. 
							What happens to spiral galaxies to make them featureless spheroids? 
							How does the structure of stars, gas, and dust change during this process?
							I use <strong>multi-wavelength observations</strong>, <strong>morphology analysis</strong> and 
							<strong>machine learning</strong> to answer these questions!

							Galaxies evolve from blue, star-forming disks to 
							red-and-dead bulge-dominated galaxies.
							But why do structure and star formation properties change at the same time?
						</p>
						<p>
							Galaxy structure (stars) are only affected by gravity, while star formation fuel (gas) is much 
							easier to remove by hydrodynamical effects. How do <strong>quenching mechanisms</strong> give 
							rise to both gravitational and hydrodynamical forces that drive this evolution?

						<p>
							I study the structural evolution of galaxies using morphology analysis, multi-wavelength data, 
							and machine learning. There are a million image processing and data science tools in the software
							industry that we tend not to use in astronomy and I am always curious to try new ones. After all,
							if self-driving cars and detect crowds of pedestrians, shouldn't we also be able to detect regular-looking 
							blobs in the sky?

						<h1>Outreach</h1>
						<p>
							I don't think everyone in the world should be a scientist - there are far more important jobs. From time 
							to time though, we should all remember that night from our childhood when we stood alone in the dark,
							listening to the gleaming stars and the faint whisper of the endless empty Universe. Amazed, lonely,
							and scared; wondering - who are we? Where did we come from?
						</p>
						<p>
							That kid is in all of us, keeping us moving forward. I love reminding others of that 
							distant memory: through public talks, stargazing nights, or even chats on the bus. 
						</p>
						<p>
							But science is not all romance either. It's one of the areas of study that finally (and 
							recently!) managed to formulate its requirements for rigour and proof. Scientists have to develop
							the critical analysis abilities that are very much needed in today's chaotic 
							reality filled with contradicting narratives. Talking not only about the wonders of science, but 
							also concepts like statistics and cognitive biases is crucial, and as scientists 
							we are well-equipped for this kind of outreach.
						</p>
							So, science outreach is really important... but also really fun! I enjoy getting
							involved in various outreach activities, and I recommend everyone else try it too.

								Something I'm thinking a lot about now: we live in a world surrounded by data and different news sources.
									As scientists, we know how to deal with data, how to filter out unreliable information, and whether 
									something is just a coincidence or a real pattern. Most importantly, we've learn to understand 
									statistics: is this vaccine effective? Is climate change science significant? 
									At the same time, the most we learn about statistics in school (if anything) is just the odds of drawing balls 
									out of a black box. One of my goals in the future is to host a series of outreach talks about practical 
									statistics for adults - or how to survive in the modern world.
