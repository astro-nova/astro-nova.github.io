							My name is <strong>Liza Sazonova</strong> and I am finishing my PhD at Johns Hopkins University. I work with 
							Katey Alatalo, Kate Rowlands, and the rest of the wonderful <a href="http://www.spogs.org/">SPOGs team</a>. We are studying
							why and how do galaxies die -- focusing on many facets of this process.
						</p>
						<p class="major">
							I study the <strong>structure of dying galaxies</strong>. What happens to spiral disk galaxies that
							they become featureless, bulge early-types? How does the structure of stars, gas, and dust change?
							I use <strong>multi-wavelength observations</strong>, <strong>morphology analysis</strong> and 
							<strong>machine learning</strong> to answer these questions!

							Galaxies evolve from blue, star-forming disks to 
							red-and-dead bulge-dominated galaxies. <br />
							But why do structure and star formation change at the same time?
						<p>
						<p>
							Galaxy structure (stars) are only affected by gravity, while star formation fuel (gas) is much 
							easier to remove by hydrodynamical effects. How do <strong>quenching mechanisms</strong> give 
							rise to both gravitational and hydrodynamical forces that drive this evolution?
						</p>
						<div id="researchBanner"></div>
						<p>
							I study the structural evolution of galaxies using morphology analysis, multi-wavelength data 
							(and recently, machine learning). I like data science and image analysis, 
							and I think this is a really cool problem to solve with these tools!

									  We found that 2 out of 4 high-redshift clusters have many more <em>compact</em>,

						<h1>Outreach</h1>
						<p>
							STEM outreach is really important in the world we live in now, but also really fun! I enjoy getting
							involved in various outreach activities, and I recommend everyone else try it too. Non-scientist have the 
							best science questions!
						</p>
						<div class="container gx-0">

								<div class="col">
									I am currently a co-chair of the <a href="https://pagsoutreach.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">PAGS outreach group</a>.
									We organize visits to local Baltimore public schools to show physics demonstrations and a planetarium show.
									We also work with local children's groups and libraries to organize events elsewhere, and host an open 
									house at the Physics department for kids and their parents to see our demos there. If you're interested in 
									collaborating, please reach out on our website!
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									I am a regular contributor to <a href='https://imascientist.org.uk/' target="_blank"><i>I'm a Scientist, Get me out of 
									here!</i></a> program. Scientists from around the world get to have online chats with UK school students, 
									and answer their questions on a public forum. It is a lot of fun!
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									I participated in <a href="https://prescientist.org/" target="_blank"><i>Letters to a Pre-scientist</i></a> program,
									where scientists write <strong>hand-written (!!!)</strong> letters to school children in remote and 
									rural US schools. We write about our science, but also what it's like to be an academic and how to
									become a scientist.
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									I hosted an Astronomy Q&A room on the <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/" target="_blank">ClubHouse</a> 
									platform as part of Science in Russia group, and lead a Russian-language blog on astronomy on 
									<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sai_and_science/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
									I'm interested in using new social media platforms to reach teenagers and young adults worldwide, and 
									I think there is a lot of potential in expanding STEM outreach to these virtual circles. If you think so too,
									let's chat!
								</div>
								<div class="col">
									
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								Something I'm thinking a lot about now: we live in a world surrounded by data and different news sources.
									As scientists, we know how to deal with data, how to filter out unreliable information, and whether 
									something is just a coincidence or a real pattern. Most importantly, we've learn to understand 
									<strong>statistics</strong>: is this vaccine effective? Is climate change science significant? 
									At the same time, the most we learn about statistics before STEM (if anything) is about drawing balls 
									out of a black box. I would like to do a series of outreach talks, or host a course, about <strong>practical 
									statistics for adults</strong> -- or how to survive in the modern world.

							and my workspace is always open to anyone who might need an ally in any situation. 
							I think academia has a long way to go to break old traditions and structural 
							inequalities to truly be inclusive, but we should definitely work on it!
